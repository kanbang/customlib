        <h1>Smart Home Control - Introduction</h1>
        The Smart Home control application demonstrate the capabilities of <b>QtQuick</b>. <b>QtQuick</b> is a smart and
        quick solution to make a platform independent application just with some basic knowledge of scripting languages 
	as JavaScript. <b>QtQuick</b> combines the huge capabilities of the Qt framework with the straightforwardness of 
	a scripting language. So <b>QtQuick</b> is really the best of both worlds. <b>QtQuick</b> serves a multi-purpose 
	state system, versatile animations and smooth transitions out-of-the-box. Hence <b>QtQuick</b> is the best way to
	create next generation user interfaces. A new standard is born, you should participate...<br>
	Additionally you can easily integrate C++ or JavaScript elements into your <b>QtQuick</b> projects if you like.<br>
        <br>
        Back to the Smart Home application.<br>
        The intention of this application is to realize a smart home control application with <b>QtQuick.</b><br>
        You can adjust when the windows have to close/open, heating has to be turned on/off, blinds have to go up/down
        and also when the lights have to be turned on/off. Consequently these settings are made depending on the weather conditions.<br>
        Therefore the current weather conditions are illustrated in the main screen.<br>
        <br>
        The nicest thing is that you can adjust the weather as you like in the "weather god control" mode.<br>
        <br>
        This project uses nested JavaScript function for all logic parts in their QML-Files.<br>
        Additionally a C++ plugin provides a smooth SVG image element.<br>
        Despite the default Image element the new SVG image element provides dynamic SVG features.<br>
        Furthermore the C++ plugin provides a convenience class for date and time.<br>
        Besides this tons of animations, transitions and states are integrated to get <br>
        fluid and smooth conrol flow.<br>
        <br>
        Just take a look into this project presented by <a href="http://www.basyskom.de/index.pl/enhome">basysKom</a> and <a href=http://qt.nokia.com/>Nokia</a>.<br>
        <br>
        To start the Smart Home Control change directory where you unpacked the code and type the following commands in the console:<br>
	<b><i>qmake</i></b><br>
	<b><i>make</i></b><br>
        <b><i>qmlviewer smarthome.qml</i></b><br>
        <br>
